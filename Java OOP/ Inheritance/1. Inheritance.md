# Java Inheritance

Inheritance is one of the key features of OOP that allows us to create a new class from an existing class.

The new class that is created is known as **subclass** (child or derived class) and the existing class from where the child class is derived is known as **superclass** (parent or base class).

The `extends` keyword is used to perform inheritance in Java. For example,

```java
class Animal {
  // methods and fields
}

// use of extends keyword
// to perform inheritance
class Dog extends Animal {

  // methods and fields of Animal
  // methods and fields of Dog
}
```

In the above example, the `Dog` class is created by inheriting the methods and fields from the `Animal` class.

Here, `Dog` is the subclass and `Animal` is the superclass.



## Example 1: Java Inheritance

```java
class Animal {

  // field and method of the parent class
  String name;
  public void eat() {
    System.out.println("I can eat");
  }
}

// inherit from Animal
class Dog extends Animal {

  // new method in subclass
  public void display() {
    System.out.println("My name is " + name);
  }
}

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // create an object of the subclass
    Dog labrador = new Dog();

    // access field of superclass
    labrador.name = "Rohu";
    labrador.display();

    // call method of superclass
    // using object of subclass
    labrador.eat();

  }
}
```



**Output**

```cmd
My name is Rohu
I can eat
```



In the above example, we have derived a subclass `Dog` from superclass `Animal`. Notice the statements,

```java
labrador.name = "Rohu";

labrador.eat();
```

Here, `labrador` is an object of `Dog`. However, `name` and `eat()` are the members of the `Animal` class.

Since `Dog` inherits the field and method from `Animal`, we are able to access the field and method using the object of the `Dog`.

## Example 2

```java
class Vehicle {
  protected String brand = "Ford";        // Vehicle attribute
  public void honk() {                    // Vehicle method
    System.out.println("Tuut, tuut!");
  }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
  private String modelName = "Mustang";    // Car attribute
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // Create a myCar object
    Car myCar = new Car();

    // Call the honk() method (from the Vehicle class) on the myCar object
    myCar.honk();

    // Display the value of the brand attribute (from the Vehicle class) and the value of the modelName from the Car class
    System.out.println(myCar.brand + " " + myCar.modelName);
  }
}
```

Did you notice the `protected` modifier in Vehicle?

We set the **brand** attribute in **Vehicle** to a `protected` [access modifier](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_modifiers.asp). If it was set to `private`, the Car class would not be able to access it.







## Why And When To Use "Inheritance"?

\- It is useful for code reusability: reuse attributes and methods of an existing class when you create a new class.

**Tip:** Also take a look at the next chapter, [Polymorphism](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_polymorphism.asp), which uses inherited methods to perform different tasks.





## is-a relationship

In Java, inheritance is an **is-a** relationship. That is, we use inheritance only if there exists an is-a relationship between two classes. For example,

- **Car** is a **Vehicle**
- **Orange** is a **Fruit**
- **Surgeon** is a **Doctor**
- **Dog** is an **Animal**

Here, **Car** can inherit from **Vehicle**, **Orange** can inherit from **Fruit**, and so on.
