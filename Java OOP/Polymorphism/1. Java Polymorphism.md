# Java Polymorphism

 

Polymorphism is an important concept of object-oriented programming. It simply means more than one form. It occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

That is, the same entity (method or operator or object) can perform different operations in different scenarios. 

Like we specified in the previous chapter; [**Inheritance**](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_inheritance.asp) lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. **Polymorphism** uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.



## Example 1

For example, think of a superclass called `Animal` that has a method called `animalSound()`. Subclasses of Animals could be Pigs, Cats, Dogs, Birds - And they also have their own implementation of an animal sound (the pig oinks, and the cat meows, etc.).

Remember from the [Inheritance chapter](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_inheritance.asp) that we use the `extends` keyword to inherit from a class.

Now we can create `Pig` and `Dog` objects and call the `animalSound()` method on both of them:

```java
class Animal {
  public void animalSound() {
    System.out.println("The animal makes a sound");
  }
}

class Pig extends Animal {
  public void animalSound() {
    System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  public void animalSound() {
    System.out.println("The dog says: bow wow");
  }
}

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Animal myAnimal = new Animal();  // Create a Animal object
    Animal myPig = new Pig();  // Create a Pig object
    Animal myDog = new Dog();  // Create a Dog object
    myAnimal.animalSound();
    myPig.animalSound();
    myDog.animalSound();
  }
}
```

**Output**

```cmd
The animal makes a sound
The pig says: wee wee
The dog says: bow wow
```





## Example 2

```java
class Polygon {

  // method to render a shape
  public void render() {
    System.out.println("Rendering Polygon...");
  }
}

class Square extends Polygon {

  // renders Square
  public void render() {
    System.out.println("Rendering Square...");
  }
}

class Circle extends Polygon {

  // renders circle
  public void render() {
    System.out.println("Rendering Circle...");
  }
}

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    // create an object of Square
    Square s1 = new Square();
    s1.render();

    // create an object of Circle
    Circle c1 = new Circle();
    c1.render();
  }
}
```

**Output**

```cmd
Rendering Square...
Rendering Circle...
```



In the above example, we have created a superclass: Polygon and two subclasses: Square and Circle. Notice the use of the `render()` method.

The main purpose of the `render()` method is to render the shape. However, the process of rendering a square is different than the process of rendering a circle.

Hence, the `render()` method behaves differently in different classes. Or, we can say `render()` is polymorphic.







# Why Polymorphism?

Polymorphism allows us to create consistent code. In the previous example, we can also create different methods: `renderSquare()` and `renderCircle()` to render Square and Circle, respectively.

This will work perfectly. However, for every shape, we need to create different methods. It will make our code inconsistent.

To solve this, polymorphism in Java allows us to create a single method `render()` that will behave differently for different shapes.

**Note**: The `print()` method is also an example of polymorphism. It is used to print values of different types like `char`, `int`, `string`, etc.
