## Method Overriding in Java Inheritance

In **Example 1**, we see the object of the subclass can access the method of the superclass.

**However, if the same method is present in both the superclass and subclass, what will happen?**

In this case, the method in the subclass overrides the method in the superclass. This concept is known as method overriding in Java.



### Example 2: Method overriding in Java Inheritance

```java
class Animal {

  // method in the superclass
  public void eat() {
    System.out.println("I can eat");
  }
}

// Dog inherits Animal
class Dog extends Animal {

  // overriding the eat() method
  @Override
  public void eat() {
    System.out.println("I eat dog food");
  }

  // new method in subclass
  public void bark() {
    System.out.println("I can bark");
  }
}

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // create an object of the subclass
    Dog labrador = new Dog();

    // call the eat() method
    labrador.eat();
    labrador.bark();
  }
}
```
